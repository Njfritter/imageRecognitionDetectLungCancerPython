# imageRecognitionDetectLungCancerPython

## Abstract
-This repo is dedicated to using data science methods in Python to analyze low-dose CT images of patient lungs to attempt to determine whether cancer will develop within a year.
-This data comes from the annual [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/data) that took place in 2017 and is linked
-We use various machine learning methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, Principal Component Analysis and 
Decision Trees/Random Forests. We will look closely at each of these methods and choose the best method based on accuracy + insight into the relationships between expalnatory variables 
-First we sample these methods on one of the most used, well-known set of images out there: The MNIST data set. Each method is used and analyzed for effectiveness (currently the KNN code is not working)
-After we dip our feet in each of these methods, we create a database to extract as much data as we choose (the data set is 66.88 GB after all...) and then go HAM on Machine Learning!!!
